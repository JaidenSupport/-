Hello [YouTuber],
I was recently watching one of your videos when I found a bunch of UTTP reply bots in the comment section. This is concerning because if a minor clicked on one of these spambots, they would be brought to a video which redirects them to a Discord server. The owner of this server has distributed CSAM on multiple occasions to anyone who messages them. To combat this issue, I created a list of accounts you should hide from your YouTube channel. Hiding someone is easy: go to YouTube Studio, then Settings, then Community. Scroll down until you see "Hidden Users" and add the following: '@OfficerAlphrow-yl4wr @Alphrom @UTTPOfficerMAP @UTubeTrollPoIiceNWO' I will keep an updated list of spambots at 'https://github.com/JaidenSupport/Spambot/blob/main/list.txt'. The best way to defeat them is to hide them. Please don't make a video about this; they feed off your attention!
